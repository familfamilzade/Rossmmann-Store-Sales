# Rossmmann Store Sales
<strong>Data Science / Machine Learning project</strong> <br/><br/>
<strong>The test and train datasets can be taken from the website:</strong> <i>https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data</i><br/><br/>
The challenge of the project is to predict the number of sales for the given date based on hostorical data. The project has been done in Python and .ipynb file includes all of the coding. Because of the size of the train dataset I was not able to upload that file here but the link shown above can be used to get the datasets (both test and train datasets).
